# huzzbot
this repo contains a script for a discord bot that plays music with stylised commands, using the discord.py library

## Dependencies
`pip install discord.py`
`pip install python-dotenv`
`pip install yt-dlp`
`pip install PyNaCl`
**FFmpeg** will also be required to be installed https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
can be done by storing the executable file (.exe) in this folder structure: *bin/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe

Also ensure you have created a bot to write code to by going here: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html

Once those tasks are complete, simply run the script and feel free to use the bot as is or adjust it as you like :)
